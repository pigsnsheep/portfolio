    <h1>Vagus Nerve Imaging ‚Äì Grill Lab, Duke University</h1>
    <p>
      Developed computer vision and graph-based analysis tools for 3D histology imaging 
      of the vagus nerve, a key target for electrical stimulation therapies. 
      The goal was to automate segmentation, fiber tracking, and error detection, 
      enabling researchers to better understand how stimulation parameters affect nerve function.
    </p>

    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>
      Manual tracing of nerve fibers from histological images is slow and error-prone, 
      often taking hours per patient. Additionally, segmentation algorithms can misclassify 
      nerve regions, requiring labor-intensive corrections. 
      The goal was to build automated, data-driven pipelines to accelerate analysis 
      and improve reproducibility.
    </p>

    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Segmentation Analysis:</strong> Applied OpenCV‚Äôs <code>connectedComponents</code> algorithm 
        to identify distinct nerve profiles in each image slice and separate the main trunk 
        from branching structures.</li>
      <li><strong>Graph Construction:</strong> Connected fibers between frames using area overlap metrics 
        and converted results into interpretable network structures using <code>igraph</code>.</li>
      <li><strong>Classification of Errors:</strong> Computed color statistics for each region 
        and trained a <code>LogisticRegression</code> model (scikit-learn) to detect segmentation mistakes.</li>
      <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Profiled the pipeline with <code>cProfile</code> and <code>snakeviz</code>, 
        achieving a 20√ó runtime improvement through memory management and algorithmic pruning.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Backtracking:</strong> Given fiber composition data at a specific frame, 
        implemented an algorithm to backtrack and infer composition for prior frames ‚Äî 
        enabling more targeted stimulation planning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Automated fiber detection reduced manual analysis time by ~8 hours per patient.</li>
      <li>Achieved 20√ó performance speedup after profiling and optimization.</li>
      <li>Provided a framework for visualizing nerve connectivity and predicting stimulation outcomes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      This research deepened my experience in computer vision, biomedical data analysis, and 
      graph-based modeling. I gained firsthand exposure to applying software engineering and 
      machine learning principles to medical imaging ‚Äî bridging algorithmic rigor with clinical relevance.
