    <h1>Gene Expression & Cancer Drug Response</h1>
    <p>
      Research project analyzing gene expression data to predict cancer drug response. 
      Published in a peer-reviewed journal, this work combined dimensionality reduction, 
      clustering, and predictive modeling to identify biomarkers of treatment sensitivity.
    </p>

    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>
      Precision medicine depends on identifying which patients will respond to specific 
      cancer drugs. Gene expression datasets are high-dimensional (20k+ genes) and noisy, 
      making prediction challenging. The project tested the effectiveness of spectral clustering, 
      a well-known dimensionality reduction technique relatively unexplored in the field of gene 
      expression, against traditional models such as PCA, UMAP, and t-SNE.
    </p>

    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data:</strong> Downloaded and downsampled gene expression data form the Geneotype-Tissue Expression Project V9 Dataset.</li>
      <li><strong>Parameter Optimization:</strong> .</li>
      <li><strong>Benchmarking:</strong> Created PCA, UMAP, K-means, t-SNE models for comparison.</li>
      <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Used a aggregation of Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, and Davies-Bouldin scores to evaluate each model's effectivness at clustering the data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Discovered that spectral clustering performed significantly better than PCA and K-means while achieving similar scores to UMAP and t-SNE, while being twice as efficient.</li>
      <li>.</li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      This project gave me hands-on experience bridging <em>biology</em> and 
      <em>programming</em>. It strengthened my skills in dimensionality reduction, 
      graph-based clustering, and model evaluation.
