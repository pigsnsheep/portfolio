    <h1>Fitmigo ‚Äì AI Personal Trainer</h1>
    <p>
      AI-powered fitness assistant that uses computer vision and deep learning 
      to detect exercise repetitions, track form, and give real-time feedback.
    </p>

    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>
      Many people lack access to personal trainers, making it difficult to 
      maintain proper form or measure progress. Existing fitness apps often 
      only count reps without evaluating quality. The goal of Fitmigo was to 
      create an accessible, computer-vision-based trainer that delivers both 
      accuracy and feedback.
    </p>

    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pose Detection:</strong> Used <code>MediaPipe</code> for skeletal keypoint tracking across multiple joints.</li>
      <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Extracted joint angles and time-series motion vectors from pose data.</li>
      <li><strong>Neural Network Model:</strong> Trained a PyTorch classifier to detect exercise type and rep count (~95% accuracy across push-ups, squats, curls).</li>
      <li><strong>Form Evaluation:</strong> Applied rule-based thresholds on joint angles (e.g., squat depth, elbow extension) to grade form quality.</li>
      <li><strong>User Testing:</strong> ~150 live tests across different body types and lighting conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> ~95% detection accuracy for rep counting across multiple exercises.</li>
      <li><strong>Robustness:</strong> Worked under varying environments (indoor/outdoor, low-light).</li>
      <li><strong>User Adoption:</strong> Tested by 30+ peers, who highlighted real-time form feedback as most valuable feature.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      This project sharpened my skills in computer vision, time-series 
      classification, and user-centered design. It also taught me the 
      importance of combining <em>machine learning models</em> with 
      <em>domain knowledge</em> (biomechanics) for practical applications.
